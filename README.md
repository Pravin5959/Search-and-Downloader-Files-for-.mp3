# Search-and-Downloader-Files-for-.mp3
Sometimes we want a particular amount of files that are placed in a large amount of files in a folder in random manner, so as the files cannot be sorted in such a way, we can use different techniques to handle the files.
In my problem statement I had a list of 1083 'id' of songs and the songs where stored in a folder consisting of 1,10,000 songs with '.mp3' extension.
1. After importing the list, extension of all id's where given 'mp3' and we started a search for all the matching of the songs in the larger folder.
2. After the match being done, we started convertion of .mp3 file to .wav using pydub and exported only those files which we only wanted using the library.
YOU CAN ALSO USE IT FOR OTHER EXTENSION FILE BY CHANGING SOME PART OF THE REPO AND LOCATION AS PER YOUR CONVINIENCE EX. FOR IMAGE YOU CAN USE PIL IN PYTHON AND CHNANGE THE EXTENSION TO .JPG
